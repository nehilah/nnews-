 <h1 class="joy"> As Women's College Enrollment Continues to Rise, The Post-Grad Gender Pay Gap Remains Open </h1> 
    <p class="deck"> Despite the fact women have been outnumbering men in colleges across the United States, a man's degree continues to make a higher salary </p>
     <p class="byline"> <strong> By Nehilah Grand-Pierre </strong> </p>

<p> 
June 2023 marks the 60 year anniversary of the <a href= https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/centers-offices/civil-rights-center/internal/policies/equal-pay-for-equal-work> Equal Pay Act <a>, signed by President Kennedy to tackle sex based wage discrimination. However, as the anniversary draws near, the closing of the gender pay gap is not seeing much progress and has not been for the past 20 years. </p>

<p> <a href= https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/#:~:text=The%20gender%20gap%20in%20pay,%2D%20and%20part%2Dtime%20workers.> The Pew Research Center <a> has reported that over the last two decades, women have been making about 80% of their male counterparts.  </p>

<p> Additionally, U.S. Census Bureau data shows that higher education does increase earnings, however differences in wage ratios are even more drastic between men and women with a bachelor’s degree than without. Furthermore, though the post-graduate gender pay gap is not seeing much progress, women are continuing to outnumber men in colleges and universities across the United States. <p>

<p> If there are more women earning degrees, why does a man make more at the same level of education? Syracuse University sociology Professor Sean Drake, who specializes in schools and education research, cites one simple reason.  </p>

<p> “Sexism. Women tend to outperform men at every level across every racial group and socioeconomic status. So if anything, we might expect women to be paid more with the same degree. That’s what makes the pay gap that much more problematic” said Drake. </p> 

<div class= "datavis">  
<iframe title="Men Make More at Every Education Level in the US" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-9nkuE" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9nkuE/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="551" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

<p> This academic year, the Bureau reported that 58% of college students were women. The percentage of women in schools has been on a steady incline which may seem promising, but the reasons behind it, not so much. </p> 

<p> According to Drake, gender roles and gender socialization push the norm of boys being more encouraged to go outside, play sports, and socialize. With less of these liberties existing for girls growing up, often due to parental safety concerns, girls tend to spend more time at home. </p> 

<p> “This insulates them from some of the distractions boys and young men can fall into. But, the gender differences become more striking when we’re looking at students of color” said Drake. </p> 

<p> The gender pay gap is exacerbated by racial demographics as Hispanic, Black and Native American women are more likely to face the largest disparities of wages compared to white men in the workplace.  </p> 

<p> According to the <a href= https://www.aauw.org/issues/equity/pay-gap/> American Association of University Women<a>, in 2020, Hispanic women faced the largest difference making only about 55% of white men. In contrast, Asian women were cited as the closest to white male earnings, making about 87%. </p> 

<p> This June also marks the anniversary of Title IX, another important effort in creating equal opportunities for women. Part of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title IX was enforced to protect against sex-based discrimination in education programs. </p> 

<p> Moreover, with Title IX, the Office of Civil Rights settles complaints of alleged sex discrimination in schools. Yet, in a case study with 11,000 undergraduate and graduate programs done by the Wall Street Journal, it was concluded that women graduating with the same degree, from the same program as their male classmates still ended up making less on average. </p> 

<p> The Journal specifically found that men graduating with accounting degrees from Georgetown University made 55% more than their female classmates. </p>

<p> <a href= https://www.thenewshouse.com/equality/beyond-the-gender-equity-numbers/> Entitled to Equality<a> , a gender-education equality project led by Syracuse University journalism students and staff, found that though women outnumber men, the male dominated fields remain Engineering and Computer Science, with the closest to 50/50 being Business and Architecture (49/51 and 51/49 respectively). </p> 

<p> Syracuse journalism Professor Shelvia Dancy served as a faculty coordinator for the project that investigated the effectiveness of Title IX. </p> 

<p> “Strengthening Title IX’s protections and consequences can go a long way. The law itself has teeth, teeth that moved society out of the Dark Ages of 60 years ago, to where we are now” adds Dancy. </p> 

<p> With the birthdays of these works approaching and the lack of progress in the gap proving more evident, groups like AAUW remain hopeful in a brighter future. </p> 

<p> The association addresses achievement of equal pay as a multifaceted solution that requires not only change in business ethics and women advocating for themselves, but also public policy and federal reform. Such reform most notably includes the <a href= https://delauro.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/delauro-murray-introduce-paycheck-fairness-act> Paycheck Fairness Act (2023)<a> . Designed to fill in the gaps of the Equal Pay Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act would stop pay secrecy and improve solutions for discriminated employees. It is also expected to protect employees from punishment for disclosing salaries with co-workers, and provide employers with resources to ensure fair pay. </p> 

<p> The passing of the act is still anticipated, yet Drake believes the fate and the end of the post-graduate gender pay gap heavily relies on the characters of those deciding on it.</p> 

<p> “Whether it's Title IX or affirmative action, public policy that challenges the status quo makes people uncomfortable. It’s going to take people who believe in equality”. </p>
